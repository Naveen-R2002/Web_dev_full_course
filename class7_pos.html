    <!-- <h2>Position : STATIC</h2>
    <p>
      An element with position : STATIC; is not positioned in any special way;
      it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page;
    </p>
    <div class="static">This div element has position: STATIC;</div> -->

    <!-- <h2>Position : RELATIVE</h2>
    <p>
      An element with position : RELATIVE; is positioned relative to its normal position;
    </p>
    <div class="relative">This div element has position: RELATIVE;</div> -->

    <!-- <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1000px;">Position : FIXED</h2>
    <p>
      An element with position : FIXED; is positioned relative to the viewport;
      which means it always stays in the sameplace even if the page is scrolled;
    </p>
    <div class="fixed">This div element has position: fixed;</div> -->

    <!-- <h2>Position : ABSOLUTE</h2>
    <p>
      An element with position : ABSOLUTE; is positioned relative to the nearest
      positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed);
    </p>
    <div class="relative">
      This div element has position: relative;
      <div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute;</div>
    </div> -->

    <!-- <h2>Position : STICKY</h2>
    <div class="sticky">I am Sticky!</div>
    <div>
      <p style="margin-bottom:2000px">In this example, the sticky element sticks to the top of them page (top:0), when you reach its scroll position</p>
      <p>scroll back up to remove the stickyness </p>
    </div> -->
